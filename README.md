# SPICE Community Model

The Community Model supports the social cohesion across groups, by the understanding of their differences and recognizing what they have in common. The community model is responsible for storing information about explicit communities that users belong to. Additionally, it creates the implicit communities inferred from user interactions and it computes the metrics needed to define the similarity (and dissimilarity) among group of users. The Community Model will support the recommender system in the variety and serendipity to the recommendation results, that will not be oriented to the typically popular contents or based on providing similar contents to the users (the so called, filter bubble) but to the inter-group similarities and the intra-group differences.

_The research leading to these software has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement SPICE No 870811_

## Quick start

1. Install Docker Desktop following the instructions on the official [Docker web page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Launch Docker Desktop App
3. Create a `.env` file in the `deploy` folder using the `env.template` file and following the instructions in it
4. Deploy the Community Model using docker and command line:
	- Windows:
	  - Execute using command line `docker-compose --env-file .env build && docker-compose up`  from `deploy` folder.
	- Linux:
	  - Replace **`;`** with **`:`** in the last lines of the `/deploy/.env` file
	  - Execute using command line `docker-compose --env-file .env build && docker-compose up`  from `deploy` folder.


## Developing

Follow the instructions in the `deploy/env.template` file to configure a development environment.

#### API server

The API server is implemented using Node.js. Dependencies are available at package.json in the `apiServer` folder. Main dependencies are:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [express-openapi-validator](https://github.com/cdimascio/express-openapi-validator)
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

#### Database

Database is implemented using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

#### Server Loader and DAO

Are implemented using [Python](https://www.python.org)

## Demo

Demo files are located inside /demo folder. There are 4 demo files. \
- post.py: Makes Posts requests with user demographic data.
- postContribution.py: Makes Posts requests with user contribution data.
- postPerspective.py: Makes Posts requests with perspective data.
- get.py: Makes Get request to communities and monitors the job status.

Examples: \
- Data examples can be found inside /demo/data folder. Additionally, database files numerated from previous to oldest state are also provided for quick import.
- Perspective examples can be found inside /demo/perspectives folder.

## Configuration for Case Studies

- Configuration seed files can be found inside /apiServer/app/src folder. To change it, please update seedFile.json.
- Artwork data can be found inside /server-loader/prototype-clustering/communityModel/data folder. To change it, please update artworks.json.
